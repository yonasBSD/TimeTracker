## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to get TimeTracker running:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/drytrix/TimeTracker.git
cd TimeTracker

# 2. Set a strong SECRET_KEY (required for sessions & CSRF)
# Linux/macOS:
export SECRET_KEY=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))")
# Windows PowerShell:
$env:SECRET_KEY = python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

# 3. (Optional) Set admin usernames
# Linux/macOS:
export ADMIN_USERNAMES=admin,manager
# Windows PowerShell:
$env:ADMIN_USERNAMES = "admin,manager"

# 4. Start TimeTracker
docker-compose up -d

# 5. Access the application
# Open your browser to: https://localhost
# (Self‑signed certificate; your browser will show a warning the first time.)

# Prefer plain HTTP on port 8080 instead?
# Use the example compose that publishes the app directly:
# docker-compose -f docker-compose.example.yml up -d
# Then open: http://localhost:8080

# Note: Login with the username you set in ADMIN_USERNAMES (default: admin) to get admin access
```

**That's it!** TimeTracker is now running with PostgreSQL.

> Important: The default `docker-compose.yml` expects `SECRET_KEY` to be set. You can also edit the file and replace `SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here` with a securely generated value. Never use weak or guessable keys.

### Option 2: Quick Test (SQLite)

Want to try it without setting up a database?

```bash
# Start with SQLite (no database setup needed)
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.local-test.yml up --build

# Access at: http://localhost:8080
```

Perfect for testing and development!

### Option 3: Manual Installation

For advanced users who prefer manual setup:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# 3. Initialize database
python -c "from app import create_app; app = create_app(); app.app_context().push(); app.initialize_database()"

# 4. Run the application
python app.py
```

## 🔑 First Login

1. **Open TimeTracker** in your browser: `http://localhost:8080`

2. **Enter your credentials** (depends on authentication method configured)
   - **Default (`AUTH_METHOD=local`)**: Enter username and password. **Note**: The default admin user has no password set initially. On first login, enter the admin username (e.g. `admin`) and choose any password (minimum 8 characters). Your password is set and you are logged in.
   - **No authentication (`AUTH_METHOD=none`)**: Enter username only (no password)
   - **OIDC (`AUTH_METHOD=oidc`)**: Click "Sign in with SSO" button
   - **Both (`AUTH_METHOD=both`)**: Choose either SSO or local username/password
   - **LDAP (`AUTH_METHOD=ldap`)**: Sign in with directory username and password (no SSO button)
   - **All methods (`AUTH_METHOD=all`)**: SSO button plus username/password (local and/or LDAP, depending on account)

3. **Admin users are configured in the environment**
   - Set via `ADMIN_USERNAMES` environment variable (default: `admin`)
   - When you login with a username matching the list, you get admin role
   - Example: If `ADMIN_USERNAMES=admin,manager`, logging in as "admin" or "manager" gives admin access
   - **Important**: Only the first username in the list is automatically created during database initialization. Additional admin usernames must either self-register (if `ALLOW_SELF_REGISTER=true`) or be created manually by an existing admin user.

4. **You're in!** Welcome to your dashboard

> **Note**: Authentication method is configured via the `AUTH_METHOD` environment variable:
> - `none`: Username only (for trusted internal networks)
> - `local`: Username + password (default, recommended)
> - `oidc`: Single Sign-On only
> - `ldap`: LDAP directory only
> - `both`: OIDC and local password (no LDAP)
> - `all`: Local + OIDC + LDAP
> 
> See [OIDC Setup Guide](admin/configuration/OIDC_SETUP.md#5-authentication-methods) and [LDAP Setup](admin/configuration/LDAP_SETUP.md) for details.

## ⚙️ Initial Setup

### Guided setup on first run

The **first time** you open TimeTracker (before setup is complete), you are shown a **guided setup wizard** at `/setup`. It walks you through:

- **Region & time** – Timezone, date/time format, currency
- **Company** – Company name, address, email (for invoices)
- **System** – Self-registration, time rounding, single active timer, idle timeout
- **Integrations (optional)** – Google Calendar OAuth; can be skipped
- **Privacy** – Opt-in for anonymous telemetry

After you complete the wizard, you can log in and fine-tune anything in **Admin → Settings**. If setup was already completed (e.g. by someone else), you go straight to the login/dashboard.

### Step 1: Configure System Settings (Admin)

> **Important**: You need admin access for this step. Login with a username from `ADMIN_USERNAMES` (default: `admin`).

1. Go to **Admin → Settings** (in the left sidebar menu, expand "Admin", then click "Settings")

The Admin Settings page has multiple sections. Configure what you need:

#### General Settings
- **Timezone**: Your local timezone (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/Rome`)
- **Currency**: Your preferred currency (e.g., `USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`)

#### Timer Settings
- **Rounding (Minutes)**: Round to nearest 1/5/15 minutes
- **Idle Timeout (Minutes)**: Auto-pause after idle (default: 30)
- **Single Active Timer**: When enabled (default), a user cannot start another timer until the current running entry is stopped. When disabled, multiple concurrent timers are allowed. The value is stored in the database (**System Settings**); the `SINGLE_ACTIVE_TIMER` environment variable only seeds that row on first install—after that, changes in the admin UI apply immediately to web, REST v1, and kiosk timer starts.

#### User Management
- **Allow Self-Registration**: ☑ Enable this to let users create accounts by entering any username and password on the login page. When enabled, anyone can create an app user with whatever credentials they type—there is no link to database credentials. **Security note**: Avoid using your database username (e.g. `timetracker`) as an app username, and do not share database passwords. With self-register enabled, someone could create an app account with credentials that match your DB user, which can be confusing or a security risk.
- **Note**: Admin users are set via `ADMIN_USERNAMES` environment variable, not in this UI

#### Company Branding
- **Company Name**: Your company or business name
- **Company Email**: Contact email for invoices
- **Company Phone**: Contact phone number
- **Company Website**: Your website URL
- **Company Address**: Your billing address (multi-line)
- **Tax ID**: Optional tax identification number
- **Bank Information**: Optional bank account details for invoices
- **Company Logo**: Upload your logo (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, WEBP)

#### Invoice Defaults
- **Invoice Prefix**: Prefix for invoice numbers (e.g., `INV`)
- **Invoice Start Number**: Starting number for invoices (e.g., 1000)
- **Default Payment Terms**: Terms text (e.g., "Payment due within 30 days")
- **Default Invoice Notes**: Footer notes (e.g., "Thank you for your business!")

#### Additional Settings
- **Backup Settings**: Retention days and backup time
- **Export Settings**: CSV delimiter preference
- **Privacy & Analytics**: Allow analytics to help improve the application

2. **Click "Save Settings"** at the bottom to apply all changes

> **💡 Tip**: Don't confuse this with the **Settings** option in your account dropdown (top right) - that's for personal/user preferences. System-wide settings are in **Admin → Settings** in the left sidebar.
