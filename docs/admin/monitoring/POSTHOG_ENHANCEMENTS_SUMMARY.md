# PostHog Enhancements Summary

## 🎯 Overview

TimeTracker now leverages PostHog's full potential for world-class product analytics and telemetry. This document summarizes all enhancements made to maximize value from PostHog.

## ✅ What We've Implemented

### 1. **Person Properties & Identification** 🆔

**What:** Every user and installation is identified in PostHog with rich properties.

**User Identification (on login):**
```python
identify_user(user.id, {
    "$set": {
        "role": "admin",
        "is_admin": True,
        "last_login": "2025-10-20T10:30:00",
        "auth_method": "oidc"
    },
    "$set_once": {
        "first_login": "2025-01-01T12:00:00",
        "signup_method": "local"
    }
})
```

**Installation Identification (on telemetry):**
```python
{
    "$set": {
        "current_version": "3.0.0",
        "current_platform": "Linux",
        "environment": "production",
        "deployment_method": "docker",
        "timezone": "Europe/Berlin"
    },
    "$set_once": {
        "first_seen_version": "2.8.0",
        "first_seen_platform": "Linux"
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Segment users by role, auth method, first login date
- ✅ Track installation characteristics over time
- ✅ Build cohorts for targeted analysis
- ✅ Understand upgrade patterns

### 2. **Group Analytics** 📦

**What:** Installations are grouped by version and platform for cohort analysis.

**Version Groups:**
```python
posthog.group_identify(
    group_type="version",
    group_key="3.0.0",
    properties={"version_number": "3.0.0"}
)
```

**Platform Groups:**
```python
posthog.group_identify(
    group_type="platform",
    group_key="Linux",
    properties={"platform_name": "Linux"}
)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Analyze all installations on a specific version
- ✅ Compare behavior across platforms
- ✅ Track adoption of new versions
- ✅ Identify platform-specific issues

### 3. **Enhanced Event Properties** 🔍

**What:** All events now include rich contextual data.

**User Events:**
```python
{
    "$current_url": "https://app.example.com/dashboard",
    "$browser": "Chrome",
    "$device_type": "desktop",
    "$os": "Linux",
    "environment": "production",
    "app_version": "3.0.0",
    "deployment_method": "docker"
}
```

**Telemetry Events:**
```python
{
    "app_version": "3.0.0",
    "platform": "Linux",
    "python_version": "3.12.0",
    "environment": "production",
    "deployment_method": "docker"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Better context for every event
- ✅ Filter events by environment, browser, OS
- ✅ Understand deployment patterns
- ✅ Correlate issues with specific configurations

### 4. **Automatic User Identification on Login** 🔐

**What:** Users are automatically identified when they log in (both local and OIDC).

**Modified Files:**
- `app/routes/auth.py` - Added identify_user calls on successful login

**Properties Set:**
- Role and admin status
- Auth method (local/OIDC)
- Last login timestamp
- First login timestamp (set once)
- Signup method (set once)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No manual identification needed
- ✅ Consistent person properties
- ✅ Track user journey from first login
- ✅ Segment by role and auth method

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Implementation
1. **`app/utils/telemetry.py`**
   - Added `_get_installation_properties()`
   - Added `_identify_installation()`
   - Added `_update_group_properties()`
   - Enhanced `send_telemetry_ping()` with person/group properties

2. **`app/__init__.py`**
   - Added `identify_user()` function
   - Enhanced `track_event()` with contextual properties
   - Added browser, device, URL context to events

3. **`app/routes/auth.py`**
   - Added `identify_user()` calls on local login
   - Added `identify_user()` calls on OIDC login
   - Set person properties on every login

### Documentation
4. **`POSTHOG_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md`** (NEW)
   - Complete guide to all features
   - Usage examples and best practices
   - PostHog query examples

5. **`POSTHOG_ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`** (THIS FILE)
   - Summary of all changes

### Tests
6. **`tests/test_telemetry.py`**
   - Updated to match enhanced property names

## 🚀 What You Can Do Now

### 1. **Segmentation & Cohorts**
- Segment users by role, admin status, auth method
- Group installations by version, platform, deployment method
- Build cohorts for targeted analysis

### 2. **Deployment toggles (not PostHog)**

Rollouts, kill switches, and route-level gates use **environment variables** and [`app/config.py`](../../../app/config.py), not a PostHog feature-flag module.

### 3. **Version Analytics**
- Track how many installations are on each version
- Identify installations that need updates
- Measure update adoption speed

### 4. **Platform Analytics**
- Compare behavior across Linux, Windows, macOS
- Identify platform-specific issues
- Optimize for most common platforms

### 5. **User Behavior Analysis**
- Filter events by user role
- Analyze admin vs regular user behavior
- Track feature adoption by user segment

### 6. **Installation Health**
- Monitor active installations (telemetry.health events)
- Track deployment methods (Docker vs native)
- Geographic distribution via timezone

## 📊 Example PostHog Queries

### **Active Installations by Version**
```
Event: telemetry.health
Time range: Last 7 days
Group by: app_version
Breakdown: platform
```

### **New Features by User Role**
```
Event: feature_interaction
Filter: Person property "role" = "admin"
Breakdown: feature_flag
```

### **Update Adoption Timeline**
```
Event: telemetry.update
Filter: new_version = "3.0.0"
Group by: Day
Cumulative: Yes
```

### **Login Methods Distribution**
```
Event: auth.login
Breakdown: auth_method
Visualization: Pie chart
```

### **Docker vs Native Comparison**
```
Event: timer.started
Filter: Person property "deployment_method" = "docker"
Compare to: All users
```

## 🎨 Setting Up in PostHog

### 1. **Create Cohorts**

**Docker Admins:**
```
Person properties:
  is_admin = true
  deployment_method = docker
```

**Recent Installs:**
```
Person properties:
  first_seen_version = "3.0.0"
Events:
  telemetry.install within last 30 days
```

### 2. **Build Dashboards**

**Installation Health:**
- Active installations (last 24h)
- Version distribution
- Platform distribution
- Update timeline

**User Engagement:**
- Daily active users
- Feature usage by role
- Timer activity
